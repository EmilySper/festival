                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>At Brighter Days, we are committed to breaking the silence around 
                    mental health and shining a light on depression—an often invisible 
                    struggle faced by millions. Our mission is to create a vibrant, 
                    supportive space where conversations about mental health are not 
                    only welcomed but celebrated.</p>

                <p>This festival is more than just music, art, and community; 
                    it’s a movement to spread awareness, encourage understanding, 
                    and equip individuals with the knowledge to recognize the signs 
                    of depression in themselves and others. Through interactive 
                    workshops, inspiring talks, and creative activities, we aim to 
                    empower festival-goers with the tools to support mental well-being 
                    and foster resilience.</p>
                    
                <p>We believe in the power of connection, self-expression, and 
                    shared experiences to promote healing and understanding. Whether 
                    you’re here to dance under the stars, connect with mental health 
                    advocates, or simply find solace in knowing you’re not alone, 
                    Brighter Days is a safe and inclusive space for everyone.</p>
                    
                <p>Together, let’s break the stigma, recognize the symptoms, and 
                    take steps toward a healthier, happier future for all.</p>
                
                <p>We have partnered with <a href="https://www.fountainhouse.org/" class="fh">Fountain House</a> 
                    and <a href="https://afsp.org/" class="af">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</a> to help provide 
                        access to mental health care and resources to start your mental health journey.
